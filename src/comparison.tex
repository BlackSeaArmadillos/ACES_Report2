\hspace{0.5cm} This chapter contains a summarize of some of the important features presented in the
previous chapter. Each processor was designed for specific tasks, and it is hard to select a
one-fits-all solution. Depending on the project initial requirements, the designers need to
study in depth and consider additional characteristics in order to decide which processor is
more suitable.
