\hspace{0.5cm} In this paper we presented the work that has been done regarding the FPGA and soft
processors world and a detailed comparison between the various solutions available, whether
it be open-source or commercial. We observed the different methods used for testing and
comparing the soft-core processors with the hard-core ones, the promising future that modern
technology brings and the distinct industrial domains in which these processors offer reliable
and performant solutions. Starting from the display applications to the deep space
exploration, the soft cores posses unlimited possibilities in terms of configuration, complexity
and performance and the technology advance will improve continuously these features. A
multitude of future options appeared during the research and the writing of this paper. From
the perspective of a fast processor to the radiation hardened one, a large number of aspects
can be approached.
